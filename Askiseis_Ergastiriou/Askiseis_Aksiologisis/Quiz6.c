Assessment Exercise 6

Write a program that simulates an ATM transaction as follows:

It will initially display a menu of options for the following functions:
Deposit money (press 1)
Withdraw money (press 2)
Update balance (press 3)

Represent the PIN as a constant and have the value 2345
The remaining amount of the account should be represented by a variable and be 1000â‚¬.
For authentication you can use the code from exercise 4 of the project. 10 which has already been implemented.
As long as the PIN is correct the program will proceed to the options menu above and execute the transaction.
In every transaction to inform the user about the balance of the account after the transaction.
